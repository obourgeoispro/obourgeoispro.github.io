In this post I will summarize the things I've learned using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] configuration system: there is
excellent documentation on the Spring Boot website, but I found out that things are a bit scattered.

The example project is available on Github: https://github.com/obourgeoispro/spring-boot-configuration-demo and it shows briefly what are the possibilities offered for configuration.

== First, the configuration file

You can use good old properties, but Spring Boot also support https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-properties-and-configuration.html#howto-use-yaml-for-external-properties[YAML configuration file]
as soon as you have SnakeYAML on the classpath. This happens if you import on of the starters such as ```spring-cloud-starter-config``` in this project, along with the bean validation API and crypto API.

[source,yaml]
----

configuration-app: <1>
  api-url: http://localhost:8080/api
  api-key: '{cipher}da1013c5bc07e9bb8de82d082f72504f6852316080afeb89b46b7f54fcd320ab'
  api-user: testuser
  connection-timeout: 1000
  use-ssl: false

spring:
  application:
    name: demo
  profiles:
    include: native, local
    active: native, local
  cloud:
    config:
      profile: native
      server:
        native:
          search-locations: classpath:config/  <2>

---   <3>

configuration-app:
  api-url: http://dev.apiserver.internal
  api-key: '{cipher}6b1f0b44cdc617e89f9cd0be0c28e369ac161794004d8330a572650d52de151a517a3400fdc0aba5c5b7e5e60732ff0f' <4>
  api-user: devuser
  connection-timeout: 1000
  use-ssl: true

spring:
  profiles: development
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://some-git-repo.com/configuration   <5>
----

<1> We define the ```configuration-app``` namespace that is later used in ```ConfigurationProperties```.
<2> The ```native``` profile of Spring Cloud Config is configured to use a local property file.
<3> A single YAML file can contain multiple configurations: this file contains also the ```development``` profile below this line.
<4> Properties can be encrypted using Spring Cloud.
<5> On ```development``` profile, Spring Cloud Config is configured to look for a file in an online Git repository.

[NOTE]
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-profiles.html[Spring Profiles] allows to
separate part of the configuration and make it available only in a specific environment or context. In the demo project there
are 2 profiles in the same YAML file, but they could also be in a separate file per profile.

== Use the configuration with Spring components
=== The new ```@Value()``` annotations

You can use a new syntax inherited from Groovy (which works for Java classes as well) that allows you to inject your
configuration into class members using annotations:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.stereotype.*
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*

@Component
public class MyBean {

    @Value("${api-url}") //<1>
    private String apiUrl;

    // ...
}
----
<1> New "Groovy like" syntax.

This is practical and quick, but is clearly tedious and cumbersome for anything substantial.

=== Type-safe configuration properties

So I preferred to use the new strongly typed configuration that can automatically bind the properties to a POJO"this avoid the use of
fragile String references. Here is the Bean that is used in the demo project and that is bound to the YAML file we've seen before:

[source,java]
----
package demo;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import javax.validation.constraints.Digits;
import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;
import java.net.URL;

@Component
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "configuration-app")   //<1>
public class SpringBootPropertiesApplicationSettings {

    @NotNull
    private URL apiUrl;        //<2>
    @NotNull
    private String apiKey;
    @NotNull
    private String apiUser;
    @Digits(integer = 12, fraction = 0)    //<3>
    private int connectionTimeout;
    private boolean useSSL;
----
<1> We define a configuration Bean that is configured to be bound to the properties under the namespace ```configuration-app```
<2> In YAML we are using ```api-url```, but the Bean is using ```apiUrl```, following Java conventions. This is called relaxed binding, and it just works.
<3> Standard JSR-303 annotations can be used to validate the properties.

[NOTE]
.Relaxed binding
=================================================================================
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-relaxed-binding[Relaxed binding]
is used to try different combinations of uppercase, lowercase and underscore. For instance APIURL, API-URL, api_url are all resolved to the same Java property apiUrl with setter ```setApiUrl```
=================================================================================

== Validate and avoid typos
=== Type-safe configuration and JSR-303 validation

If you are using type-safe configuration and JSR-303 annotations, shall your configuration file contain a typo or mistake, Spring will fail fast and print an error message.
[source,java]
----
Caused by: org.springframework.validation.BindException: org.springframework.validation.BeanPropertyBindingResult: 2 errors
Field error in object 'configuration-app' on field 'apiUrl': rejected value [http//localhost:8080/api]; codes [typeMismatch.configuration-app.apiUrl,typeMismatch.apiUrl,typeMismatch.java.net.URL,typeMismatch]; arguments [org.springframework.context.support.DefaultMessageSourceResolvable: codes [configuration-app.apiUrl,apiUrl]; arguments []; default message [apiUrl]]; default message [Failed to convert property value of type 'java.lang.String' to required type 'java.net.URL' for property 'apiUrl'; nested exception is org.springframework.core.convert.ConverterNotFoundException: No converter found capable of converting from type java.lang.String to type @javax.validation.constraints.NotNull java.net.URL] <1>
Field error in object 'configuration-app' on field 'connectionTimeout': rejected value [blah]; codes [typeMismatch.configuration-app.connectionTimeout,typeMismatch.connectionTimeout,typeMismatch.int,typeMismatch]; arguments [org.springframework.context.support.DefaultMessageSourceResolvable: codes [configuration-app.connectionTimeout,connectionTimeout]; arguments []; default message [connectionTimeout]]; default message [Failed to convert property value of type 'java.lang.String' to required type 'int' for property 'connectionTimeout'; nested exception is org.springframework.core.convert.ConverterNotFoundException: No converter found capable of converting from type java.lang.String to type @javax.validation.constraints.Digits int] <2>
----
<1> Informs that ```http//localhost:8080/api``` is not a valid URL and cannot be converted to java.net.URL.
<2> This field expects digits only and we provided a String as configuration.

If you want to go further with validation of properties, you can also create your own https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-samples/spring-boot-sample-property-validation[Custom validators]
and of course replace the default messages with custom (translated) messages.

=== Generate configuration meta-data for documentation and avoid typos in IDE

Spring Boot provides an annotation processor that can scan your configuration Beans and generate JSON documentation from the JavaDoc: see
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.5.RELEASE/reference/html/configuration-metadata.html#configuration-metadata-annotation-processor[Spring boot annotation processor setup]

This JSON documentation is then used by your IDE to offer completion and validation of properties on the fly: this works with Eclipse, Netbean and IntelliJ.

This is also working with the relaxed binding!

== Spring Cloud Config

http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/[Spring Cloud Config] is an extra module that provides server and client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system.

=== Encrypt sensitive properties

In Spring Cloud Config you'll also find a feature to encrypt and decrypt sensitive properties. You can use symmetric encryption with a key configured in the ```bootstrap.yml``` file,
or, more realistically, you'll want to use the system property ```ENCRYPT_KEY``` or a parameter on the command line to keep the encryption key secret. There is also
the possibility to use http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/spring-cloud-config.html#_key_management[asymmetric keys] after configuring a keystore.

To encrypt your properties, you can use the command line with http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-cli/[Spring Cloud CLI] or use the
REST endpoint ```http://localhost:8080/encrypt``` and POST the properties to encrypt.

[CAUTION]
.Exception due to "illegal key size"
You'll probably get this exception if you are using the SUN JDK, and the project README explains
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-commons[how to install the Java Cryptographic Extension] in your Java runtime.

=== Manage the Cloud configuration server

When your system grows, you usually want to streamline the deployment of new configuration and keep track of configuration changes: this can be done by storing the configuration files in source
control and deploy them using Spring Cloud Configuration server. For production it is recommended to use a Git server, but the demo project is configured to look for a property file in the default path ```resources/config``` and
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27131143/spring-cloud-configuration-server-not-working-with-local-properties-file[activates the native profile].

Spring Cloud Config also offers a mechanism to http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/spring-cloud-config.html#_push_notifications_and_spring_cloud_bus[dynamically reload the properties using a webhook] so you can trigger the reload on new commit in Github for instance.

=== A few management URLs

Here are some interesting URLs for checking and managing properties:

[cols="3*"]
|===
| Pattern
| Example
| Description

|{host}:{port}/configprops
|http://localhost:8080/configprops
|A collated list of all ```@ConfigurationProperties```

|{host}:{port}/{application}/{profile}
|http://localhost:8080/demo/default
|Properties for a specific profile

|
|http://localhost:8080/env
|Properties from ```ConfigurableEnvironment```

== Going further

We've already seen a few tricks, but that was just to whet your appetite: there is much more to discover if you read the documentation. There are also a few good reads
 I recommend that will help you to structure and rationalize the usage of configuration in your application.

== Conclusion

Spring, as an enterprise framework, always had excellent support for application configuration, and when working with Spring Boot I was glad to see that this support is even better now.
It seems to me that configuration and logging are often overlooked topics as they seem to be a mundane task, however, experience shows that to have well thought logging and application configuration can save a lot of money (e.g. time) to your company.
