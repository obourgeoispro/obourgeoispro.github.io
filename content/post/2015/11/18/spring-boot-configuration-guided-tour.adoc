In this post I will summarize everything I've learned using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] configuration system: there is
excellent documentation on the Spring Boot website, but I found out that things are a bit scattered. I hope this entry
can be of any help for developers getting started with Spring Boot.

== Getting started

=== Clone the demo project

I've created a Java based project with a Gradle build, the application properties are defined using YAML:
Link to Github project

=== The sample YAML configuration file

Let's start with the configuration file as there is  already a few things worth noting here:

[source,yaml]
----

spring:
    application:
        name: demo

configuration-app:            # <1>
  api-url: http://localhost
  api-key: 1234567890
  api-user: localuser

---

spring:
  profiles: development       # <2>
  server:
    port: 9000

demoapp:
  api-url: http://dev.apiserver.internal
  api-key: SECRET
  api-user: devuser
  skipCertificateCheck: !!bool "true"

---

spring:
  profiles: production
  server:
    port: 8080
demoapp:
  api-url: https://realstuff.com
  api-key: SECRET
  api-user: SECRET
  skipCertificateCheck: !!bool "false"
----

<1> We have a ```configuration-app``` namespace that we can use later for binding to a bean.
<2> A single YAML file can contain multiple configurations: this file contains also the ```development``` profile.

== Injecting the configuration into Spring components

=== Using ```@Value()``` annotations

You can use a new syntax inherited from Groovy (but that works with Java classes as well) that allows you to inject your
configuration into class members like this:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.stereotype.*
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*

@Component
public class MyBean {

    @Value("${api-url}") //<1>
    private String apiUrl;

    // ...
}
----
<1> New "Groovy like" syntax.

=== Using type safe configuration properties

But I preferred to use the new strongly typed configuration that can automatically bind the properties to a POJO.

Advantages:

* no dangling String in your code and you have standard code completion in any IDE.
* it is more refactoring friendly.
* you can enforce validation rules

Here is the Bean that will hold the configuration for the namespace ```configuration-app```:

[source,java]
----
package demo;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import javax.validation.constraints.Digits;
import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;
import java.net.URL;

@Component
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "configuration-app")   //<1>
public class SpringBootPropertiesApplicationSettings {

    @NotNull
    private URL apiUrl;        //<2>
    @NotNull
    private String apiKey;
    @NotNull
    private String apiUser;
    @Digits(integer = 12, fraction = 0)    //<3>
    private int connectionTimeout;
    @Digits(integer = 12, fraction = 0)
    private int connectionRequestTimeout;
----
<1> we can tell Spring that we are interested only in the namespace ```configuration-app```
<2> In YAML we are using ```api-url```, but the Java bean is using ```apiUrl```, following Java conventions. This is called relaxed binding.
<3> We can use standard annotations to enforce validation of properties.

[NOTE]
.Relaxed binding
=================================================================================
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-relaxed-binding[Relaxed binding]
works also for uppercase, lowercase and underscore.
=================================================================================

=== Error reporting and validation

Shall you make a mistake in your configuration file, Spring will print an informative error message:
[source,java]
----
Caused by: org.springframework.validation.BindException: org.springframework.validation.BeanPropertyBindingResult: 2 errors
Field error in object 'demoapp' on field 'apiUrl': rejected value [http//localhost]; codes [typeMismatch.demoapp.apiUrl,typeMismatch.apiUrl,typeMismatch.java.net.URL,typeMismatch]; arguments [org.springframework.context.support.DefaultMessageSourceResolvable: codes [demoapp.apiUrl,apiUrl]; arguments []; default message [apiUrl]]; default message [Failed to convert property value of type 'java.lang.String' to required type 'java.net.URL' for property 'apiUrl'; nested exception is org.springframework.core.convert.ConverterNotFoundException: No converter found capable of converting from type java.lang.String to type @javax.validation.constraints.NotNull java.net.URL] // <1>
Field error in object 'demoapp' on field 'apiKey': rejected value [null]; codes [NotNull.demoapp.apiKey,NotNull.apiKey,NotNull.java.lang.String,NotNull]; arguments [org.springframework.context.support.DefaultMessageSourceResolvable: codes [demoapp.apiKey,apiKey]; arguments []; default message [apiKey]]; default message [may not be null]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               // <2>
----

<1> Unfortunately here the error message is a bit confusing: the value is rejected because ```http//localhost``` cannot be converted to ```java.net.URL``` , not because of type mismatch.
<2> This error is more clear: we cannot leave apiKey empty (or null)

If you want to go further with validation of properties, you can also create your own https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-samples/spring-boot-sample-property-validation[Custom validators]

=== Generating configuration meta-data

Spring Boot provides an annotation processor that can scan your configuration Beans and generate a JSON documentation.
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.5.RELEASE/reference/html/configuration-metadata.html#configuration-metadata-annotation-processor[Spring boot annotation processor setup]

This documentation is then used by your IDE to offer completion and validation of properties:

image::../custom-props-completion.PNG[Custom properties completion, title="Custom properties completion"]
This is also working with the relaxed binding!

image::../relaxed-binding-validation.PNG[Relaxed binding validation, title="Relaxed binding validation"]

== Using Spring profiles

Spring profiles allows you to manage

Spring Boot is using https://code.google.com/p/snakeyaml/[Snake Yaml] which implements the Yaml 1.1 spec. Yaml have support
for type safe Collections and Maps

== Spring Cloud Config

=== Encrypting sensitive properties

I found the name Spring Cloud a bit misleading because in this module you also find features to encrypt properties.


=== Managing a configuration server

For production it is recommended to use a Git server, but the demo project is configured to look for a property file in the default path ```resources/config``` and we
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27131143/spring-cloud-configuration-server-not-working-with-local-properties-file[activate the native profile].


Spring Cloud Config offers a mechanism to dynamically reload properties using a REST API

== Conclusion

Spring, as an enterprise framework, always had excellent support for application configuration, and when working with Spring
Boot I was glad to see that this support is even better now.

It seems to me that configuration and logging are often overlooked topics because they seem to be a mundane task.
I believe it is important to have solid logging and application configuration as that can save a lot of money to your company.
