In this post I will summarize everything I've learned using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] configuration system: there is
excellent documentation on the Spring Boot website, but I found out that things are a bit scattered.

== Getting started

=== Clone the demo project

I've created a Java based project with a Gradle build, the application properties are defined using YAML:
https://github.com/obourgeoispro/spring-boot-configuration-demo

=== The sample YAML configuration file

Let's start with the configuration file as there are already a few things worth noting here:

[source,yaml]
----

configuration-app: <1>
  api-url: http://localhost:8080/api
  api-key: '{cipher}da1013c5bc07e9bb8de82d082f72504f6852316080afeb89b46b7f54fcd320ab'
  api-user: testuser
  connection-timeout: 1000
  use-ssl: false

spring:
  application:
    name: demo
  profiles:
    include: native, local
    active: native, local
  cloud:
    config:
      profile: native
      server:
        native:
          search-locations: classpath:config/

---   <2>

configuration-app:
  api-url: http://dev.apiserver.internal
  api-key: '{cipher}6b1f0b44cdc617e89f9cd0be0c28e369ac161794004d8330a572650d52de151a517a3400fdc0aba5c5b7e5e60732ff0f'
  api-user: devuser
  connection-timeout: 1000
  use-ssl: true

spring:
  profiles: development
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://some-git-repo.com/configuration
----

<1> We define a ```configuration-app``` namespace that is later used to bind properties to a bean.
<2> A single YAML file can contain multiple configurations: this file contains also the ```development``` profile below this line.

== Injecting the configuration into Spring components

=== Using ```@Value()``` annotations

You can use a new syntax inherited from Groovy (but that works with Java classes as well) that allows you to inject your
configuration into class members like this:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.stereotype.*
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*

@Component
public class MyBean {

    @Value("${api-url}") //<1>
    private String apiUrl;

    // ...
}
----
<1> New "Groovy like" syntax.

=== Using type safe configuration properties

But I preferred to use the new strongly typed configuration that can automatically bind the properties to a POJO.
Here is the Bean is used in the demo project:

[source,java]
----
package demo;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import javax.validation.constraints.Digits;
import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;
import java.net.URL;

@Component
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "configuration-app")   //<1>
public class SpringBootPropertiesApplicationSettings {

    @NotNull
    private URL apiUrl;        //<2>
    @NotNull
    private String apiKey;
    @NotNull
    private String apiUser;
    @Digits(integer = 12, fraction = 0)    //<3>
    private int connectionTimeout;
    private boolean useSSL;
----
<1> we can tell Spring that we are interested only in the properties from the namespace ```configuration-app```
<2> In YAML we are using ```api-url```, but the Java bean is using ```apiUrl```, following Java conventions. This is called relaxed binding.
<3> We can use standard annotations to enforce validation of properties.

[NOTE]
.Relaxed binding
=================================================================================
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-relaxed-binding[Relaxed binding]
works also for uppercase, lowercase and underscore: APIURL, API-URL, api_url are all resolved to the same property.
=================================================================================

=== Error reporting and validation

Shall you make a mistake in your configuration file, Spring will fail fast and print an informative error message:
[source,java]
----
Caused by: org.springframework.validation.BindException: org.springframework.validation.BeanPropertyBindingResult: 2 errors
Field error in object 'configuration-app' on field 'apiUrl': rejected value [http//localhost:8080/api]; codes [typeMismatch.configuration-app.apiUrl,typeMismatch.apiUrl,typeMismatch.java.net.URL,typeMismatch]; arguments [org.springframework.context.support.DefaultMessageSourceResolvable: codes [configuration-app.apiUrl,apiUrl]; arguments []; default message [apiUrl]]; default message [Failed to convert property value of type 'java.lang.String' to required type 'java.net.URL' for property 'apiUrl'; nested exception is org.springframework.core.convert.ConverterNotFoundException: No converter found capable of converting from type java.lang.String to type @javax.validation.constraints.NotNull java.net.URL] <1>
Field error in object 'configuration-app' on field 'connectionTimeout': rejected value [blah]; codes [typeMismatch.configuration-app.connectionTimeout,typeMismatch.connectionTimeout,typeMismatch.int,typeMismatch]; arguments [org.springframework.context.support.DefaultMessageSourceResolvable: codes [configuration-app.connectionTimeout,connectionTimeout]; arguments []; default message [connectionTimeout]]; default message [Failed to convert property value of type 'java.lang.String' to required type 'int' for property 'connectionTimeout'; nested exception is org.springframework.core.convert.ConverterNotFoundException: No converter found capable of converting from type java.lang.String to type @javax.validation.constraints.Digits int] <2>
----
<1> Informs that ```http//localhost:8080/api``` is not a valid URL and cannot be converted to java.net.URL
<2> Tells us that this field expects digits only and not a String

If you want to go further with validation of properties, you can also create your own https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-samples/spring-boot-sample-property-validation[Custom validators]
and of course replace the default messages with custom - translated - messages.

=== Generating configuration meta-data

Spring Boot provides an annotation processor that can scan your configuration Beans and generate JSON documentation.
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.5.RELEASE/reference/html/configuration-metadata.html#configuration-metadata-annotation-processor[see Spring boot annotation processor setup]

This JSON documentation is then used by your IDE to offer completion and validation of properties:

image::../custom-props-completion.PNG[Custom properties completion, title="Custom properties completion"]
This is also working with the relaxed binding!

image::../relaxed-binding-validation.PNG[Relaxed binding validation, title="Relaxed binding validation"]

== Using Spring profiles

Spring profiles allows you to manage configuration specific to an environment or context: in the demo project there are 2 profiles in the same YAML file.
You can also have one file per profile.


== Spring Cloud Config

=== Encrypting sensitive properties

I found the name Spring Cloud a bit misleading because in this module you also find features to encrypt properties.
To encrypt your properties, you can use the command line with http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-cli/[Spring Cloud CLI] or use the
REST endpoint ```/encrypt```.

You can use symmetric encryption with a key configured in the ```bootstrap.yml``` file, or, more realistically,
you'll want to use the system property ```ENCRYPT_KEY``` or a parameter on the command line to set up the encryption key.

There is also the possibility to use http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/spring-cloud-config.html#_key_management[asymmetric keys].

[NOTE]
.Exception due to "illegal key size"
You'll probably get this exception if you are using the SUN JDK, the README explains
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-commons[how to install the Java Cryptographic Extension]

=== Managing a configuration server

For production it is recommended to use a Git server, but the demo project is configured to look for a property file in the default path ```resources/config``` and we
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27131143/spring-cloud-configuration-server-not-working-with-local-properties-file[activate the native profile].

Spring Cloud Config offers a mechanism to dynamically reload properties using a REST API.

== Conclusion

Spring, as an enterprise framework, always had excellent support for application configuration, and when working with Spring
Boot I was glad to see that this support is even better now.

It seems to me that configuration and logging are often overlooked topics because they seem to be a mundane task.
I believe it is important to have solid logging and application configuration as that can save a lot of money to your company.
